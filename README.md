Little bit modified game based on Mat Leacock's pandemic

 * characters do not have special abilities
 * initial diseases are random
 * no special cards
 * unlimited bases
 * random infection rate per turn
 * players-controlled actions and win/lose conditions ("undo" button)

..However fully playable!

Well old school project, enjoy!
